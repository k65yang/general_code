# Assignment 1 - Question 2

Herein includes the solution and modified MATLAB code used to compute the deformations, stress, and strains for Assignment 1 Question 2. Changes to the native code is noted, and highlighted if necessary. 
  
The computed solutions matched my answer from Question 1.

## Problem solution
The computed solution matched the answer which I computed from Question 1. This is an expected result. The strains and deformations are positive indicating tension in both elements. By inspection, this result is logical and expected.  
  
The outputs of the program are shown below.

The generated figure of the original truss along with the deformed shape is shown below.

## preprocessor.m
Preprocessor values were adjusted to represent the problem truss. Pretty much all variables were changed.  

__Important Note:__  I misunderstood the IEN matrix and assumed it to represent IEN(e,i) rather than the prescribed IEN(i,e). I developed code assuming IEN(e,i), hence all instances where IEN is called in the native code, the transpose of IEN will be used (ie. IEN')

```matlab
function  [x,y,IEN,CArea,leng,phi,E,fext,fixed_dofs,fixed_values] = preprocessor

## truss.m
No adjustment were made to this code; it was simply ran to solve the truss. Due to the lack of changes, it is not shown here for brevity.

## postprocessor.m
Added code to compute the strain and stress in each element.  
Added code to plot the original truss (SOLID LINE) and the deformed truss (DASHED LINE).
```matlab
function postprocessor(d, r, x,y,IEN,CArea,leng,phi,E)

% define some constants
nsd 	= 2;	      % Number of space dimensions 
ndof 	= 2;     	  % Number of degrees-of-freedom per node
nnd     = size(x,2);  % Number of nodes
nel     = size(IEN,2);  % Number of elements
neq     = nnd*ndof;   % number of equations (dofs)

% initialize strain vector
strain_elem = zeros(nel, 1);

% initialize stress vector
stress_elem = zeros(nel, 1);

% Calcuate stresses in each element
for elem = 1:nel
    % extract material properties
    A_elem = CArea(elem);
    E_elem = E(elem);
    l_elem = leng(elem);
    
    % extract displacement vector
    ux_start = IEN(elem, 1) * ndof - 1;
    uy_start = IEN(elem, 1) * ndof;
    ux_end = IEN(elem, 2) * ndof - 1;
    uy_end = IEN(elem, 2) * ndof;
    d_elem = [ d(ux_start);
               d(uy_start);
               d(ux_end);
               d(uy_end)];
    
    % extract angles
    c = cosd(phi(elem));
    s = sind(phi(elem));
    rot_vec = [ -c -s c s]; % Adjust rotation vector
    
    % compute stress/strain
    computed_strain = rot_vec * d_elem / l_elem;
    computed_stress = E_elem * computed_strain;
    
    % update stress/strain
    strain_elem(elem) = computed_strain;
    stress_elem(elem) = computed_stress;
end

disp('Stress/Strain')
disp('Node       Strain       Sigma')
for n=1:nel
    disp([num2str(n),'       ',num2str(strain_elem(n)),'       ',num2str(stress_elem(n))]);
