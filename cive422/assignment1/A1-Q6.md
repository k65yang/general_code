# Question 6

Herein includes the required MATLAB code to solve Assignment 1 Question 6.  

## Part A
The analytical solution of the equation was found with the following code. 
```matlab
% Define variables
syms u(y); 

E = 30 * 10^9;
A = 0.25;
ro = 2400;

% Solve ordianry differential equation
ode = E*A*diff(u,y,y) - 9.81*ro*A == 0;
Du = E*A*diff(u,y);
cond = [u(0) == 0, Du(2) == -10000];
uSol(y) = dsolve(ode, cond);
solution = vpa(uSol, 5)
```
