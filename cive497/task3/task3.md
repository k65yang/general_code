## Problem 2: Convolution Theorem

## Problem 3: Discrete Fourier Transform

a) The following relationship indicates that the discrete fourier tranform of a signal is assumed to be repeating. In other words, the sampled signal Xs is the same as the summation of X(f) (ie. the frequency is the same).  

b) It is not possible to measure above the Nyquist frequency, however, that does not mean that problems are not there. Discrete fourier transform of the sampled signal will generate a frequency graph of all the signal measured below the Nyquist frequency. This does not mean that signals above the Nyquist frequency does not exist; they may exist, but will be distorted. Noted by the tips of the graphs, the frequency higher than Nyquist will wrap around and distort the sampled signal.
