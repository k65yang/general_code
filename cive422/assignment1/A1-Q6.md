# Question 6

Herein includes the required MATLAB code to solve Assignment 1 Question 6.  

## Part A
Hand calculations of the analytical solution is attached. The analytical solution of the equation was confirmed with the following code.  
```matlab
% Define variables
% Define variables
syms u(y); 

E = 30 * 10^9;
A = 0.25;
ro = 2400;

% Solve ordianry differential equation
ode = E*A*diff(u,y,y) - 9.81*ro*A == 0;
Du = E*A*diff(u,y);
cond = [u(0) == 0, Du(3) == -10000];
uSol(y) = dsolve(ode, cond);
solution = vpa(uSol, 5)
```

# Part B
Weak form of the equation was computed by hand. Additionally, the weak formed was solved using the Ritz method. As required as part of this submittal, the solution to Ritz method is shown in MATLAB code.  

```matlab
% Define Variables
syms u(y) w(y) y real; 
syms a1 a2 b1 b2 integer;

E = 30 * 10^9;
A = 0.25;
ro = 2400;

% The weak form of the equation was derived by hand in Question 6 Part b-i
% 7.5e10^9 * int(diff(w,y)*diff(u,y), [0,2]) + 10000*w(2) + 5886 * int(w,
% [0,2]) == 0

main_integral = -E*A*diff(w,y)*diff(u,y); % CHECK IF THIS IS THE CASE
other_integral = 9.81*ro*A*w;
integrand = 10000*w;

% Assume second-order polynomial approximation function 
P = [y y^2];
B = [1 2*y];
d = [a1; a2];
q = [b1; b2];

% Sub approximation functions into the weak form such that
% w = Pq                u = Pd
% diff(w,y) = Bq        diff(u.y) = Bd
% This is required to solve system of equations of form Kd = f
% The general form of K is int(B'*B). 
% The general form of F is int(P') + P'(x)
% Note that q term is factored out.

% Perform subsitution for the integrals
main_integral = subs(main_integral, diff(w,y), B');
main_integral = subs(main_integral, diff(u,y), B);
other_integral = subs(other_integral, w, P');
integrand = subs(integrand, w, P');

K = int(main_integral, [0,3])
F = int(other_integral, [0,3]) + integrand(3)

d = K \ F;
temp_output = vpa(d, 5);

% Plot approximation of u(y)
y_plot = linspace(0,3);
f(y) = vpa(P * d, 5)
x_plot = f(y_plot) * 10^3;

figure;
plot(x_plot, y_plot, 'b-', 'LineWidth', 2)
title('Approximation of u(y) with the Ritz Method');
xlabel('Deformation of column (mm)');
ylabel('Height of Column (m)');

% Plot the approximation of EAu'(y)
f_prime(y) = E*A*diff(P) * d
x_plot = f_prime(y_plot);

figure;
plot(x_plot, y_plot, 'b-', 'LineWidth', 2)
title('Approximation of EAu,(y) with the Ritz Method')
xlabel('Strain (m/m)');
ylabel('Height of Column (m)');
```

Interestingly enough, the solution of the Ritz method is equal to the exact solution. Command console output of u(y) and EAu'(y) is shown below.

Plots of the displacement of the column and the strain of the column between 0 and 2 m is shown as Figure 1 and Figure 2, respectively.
