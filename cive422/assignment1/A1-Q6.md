# Question 6

Herein includes the required MATLAB code to solve Assignment 1 Question 6.  

## Part A
Hand calculations of the analytical solution is attached. The analytical solution of the equation was confirmed with the following code.  
```matlab
% Define variables
syms u(y); 

E = 30 * 10^9;
A = 0.25;
ro = 2400;

% Solve ordianry differential equation
ode = E*A*diff(u,y,y) - 9.81*ro*A == 0;
Du = E*A*diff(u,y);
cond = [u(0) == 0, Du(2) == -10000];
uSol(y) = dsolve(ode, cond);
solution = vpa(uSol, 5)
```

# Part B
Weak form of the equation was computed by hand. Additionally, the weak formed was solved using the Ritz method. As required as part of this submittal, the solution to Ritz method is shown in MATLAB code.  

Interestingly enough, the solution of the Ritz method is equal to the exact solution. Command console output of u(y) and EAu'(y) is shown below.
